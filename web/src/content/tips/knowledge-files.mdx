# Knowledge Files

`knowledge.md` files give Codebuff context about your project: conventions, architecture decisions, commands to run.

## Getting Started

Ask Codebuff to create one:

```bash
    codebuff "Please create a knowledge.md file with initial project information"
```

Or create it yourself:

1. Create a `knowledge.md` file at the root of your project:

```bash
    touch knowledge.md
```

2. For larger projects, you can optionally create additional knowledge files in subdirectories:

```bash
    touch backend/knowledge.md frontend/knowledge.md
```

Keep each file next to the code it describes.

## What to Include

Capture facts that aren't obvious from the code:

- Project goals and mission
- Technical decisions and their rationale
- Coding standards and best practices
- Common pitfalls to avoid
- Tips for working with project-specific tools
- Links to important documentation
- Build and deployment requirements
- Testing guidelines
- Verification commands to run after changes (e.g., `npm run build`, `npm run lint`, or `npm test`)

A few hundred lines is fine.

## Post-Change Verification

Add commands for Codebuff to run after edits:

```markdown
## Verifying Changes

After any code changes, run these commands to verify correctness:

- Run `npm run typecheck` to check for type errors
- Run `npm test` to ensure tests pass
```

Codebuff runs these after making changes.
